You are a senior software architect analyzing a development task.

**Task ID:** 86evckrqg
**Title:** Create Admin Panel User Management API
**Description:**
Description:
Develop backend endpoints that power the admin panel’s user management section. The goal is to allow admins to view, search, update, and deactivate user accounts securely from the admin dashboard.
Objectives:
Implement endpoint to list all users with pagination, sorting, and search (GET /api/admin/users).
Support filters (role, status, registration date).
Implement endpoint to update user info or role (PATCH /api/admin/users/:id).
Implement endpoint to deactivate or delete a user (DELETE /api/admin/users/:id).
Include proper authorization checks — only admins can perform these actions.
Ensure consistent JSON responses for all CRUD operations.
Acceptance Criteria:
Admins can fetch paginated user lists and apply filters successfully.
User data updates reflect immediately in subsequent fetches.
Deactivating or deleting a user restricts login or access instantly.
Unauthorized users cannot access admin endpoints.
Error and success responses are standardized for the admin panel UI.

Your job is to analyze this task and create a detailed feature specification. DO NOT include any code implementation.

Please provide:

1. **Feature Overview** (2-3 sentences)
   - What needs to be built
   - Why it's needed
   - Expected outcome

2. **Files to Modify** (CRITICAL - Be Specific)
   List exact file paths that need to be created or modified:
   - `path/to/file.js` - What changes are needed
   - `path/to/another.js` - What changes are needed
   - Include both new files and existing files to modify
   - Use relative paths from repository root

3. **Technical Approach** (4-6 bullet points)
   - High-level architecture decisions
   - Which parts of the codebase will be affected
   - Any dependencies or prerequisites
   - Potential challenges

4. **Implementation Steps** (numbered list)
   - Break down into logical steps
   - Reference specific files from "Files to Modify" section
   - Order of implementation

5. **Testing Strategy** (3-4 bullet points)
   - What should be tested
   - Types of tests needed
   - Edge cases to consider
   - Which test files to create/modify

6. **Acceptance Criteria** (checklist)
   - Specific requirements that must be met
   - Definition of done
   - How to verify the feature works

Format your response in clear Markdown. Be specific about file paths and changes. Focus on WHAT and WHY, not HOW (no code).
