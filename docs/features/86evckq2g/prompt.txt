You are a senior software architect analyzing a development task.

**Task ID:** 86evckq2g
**Title:** Implement Dark Mode Toggle
**Description:**
Description:
Add a dark mode option that allows users to switch between light and dark themes throughout the application. The goal is to improve user comfort, accessibility, and personalization while maintaining consistent design across all components.
Objectives:
Add a toggle switch in the main header or settings menu.
Save the user’s theme preference (light/dark) in local storage.
Automatically detect and apply system theme preference on first visit.
Ensure all UI components adjust properly (backgrounds, text, icons).
Provide smooth transition when switching themes.
Acceptance Criteria:
Theme toggles instantly without requiring a page refresh.
User’s selected theme persists after refresh or relogin.
All pages and components are visually consistent in both modes.
No accessibility or readability issues in dark mode.
Code structure allows easy addition of more themes in the future.

Your job is to analyze this task and create a detailed feature specification. DO NOT include any code implementation.

Please provide:

1. **Feature Overview** (2-3 sentences)
   - What needs to be built
   - Why it's needed
   - Expected outcome

2. **Files to Modify** (CRITICAL - Be Specific)
   List exact file paths that need to be created or modified:
   - `path/to/file.js` - What changes are needed
   - `path/to/another.js` - What changes are needed
   - Include both new files and existing files to modify
   - Use relative paths from repository root

3. **Technical Approach** (4-6 bullet points)
   - High-level architecture decisions
   - Which parts of the codebase will be affected
   - Any dependencies or prerequisites
   - Potential challenges

4. **Implementation Steps** (numbered list)
   - Break down into logical steps
   - Reference specific files from "Files to Modify" section
   - Order of implementation

5. **Testing Strategy** (3-4 bullet points)
   - What should be tested
   - Types of tests needed
   - Edge cases to consider
   - Which test files to create/modify

6. **Acceptance Criteria** (checklist)
   - Specific requirements that must be met
   - Definition of done
   - How to verify the feature works

Format your response in clear Markdown. Be specific about file paths and changes. Focus on WHAT and WHY, not HOW (no code).
