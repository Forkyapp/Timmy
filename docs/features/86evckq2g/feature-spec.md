I cannot provide a detailed feature specification without first understanding the project's structure and technology stack in the `/Users/user/Documents/Personal-Projects/collabifi-back` repository. The current context is for a different project.

To give you the specific file paths and accurate technical approach you've requested, I need to know:

1.  What frontend framework is being used (e.g., React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, or plain HTML/CSS/JS)?
2.  What is the project's directory structure? You can provide this by running `ls -R` from the root of the `collabifi-back` repository.

Once I have this information, I can create the detailed specification you've outlined.
