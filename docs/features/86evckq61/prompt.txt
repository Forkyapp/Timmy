You are a senior software architect analyzing a development task.

**Task ID:** 86evckq61
**Title:** Build User Activity Log API
**Description:**
Description:
Develop backend functionality to store and retrieve user activity logs. This API will help track key user actions (such as login, profile update, or password change) and provide a clear history of user interactions for audit or analytics purposes.
Objectives:
Create a database table/model to store user activity (userId, actionType, description, timestamp, ipAddress).
Implement endpoint to record new activity logs (POST /api/activity).
Implement endpoint to fetch activity logs (GET /api/activity?userId=&type=&from=&to=) with pagination.
Support optional filters: date range, action type, and user ID.
Return logs sorted by timestamp (most recent first).
Apply proper validation and error handling for requests.
Acceptance Criteria:
Logs are stored reliably for all tracked user actions.
API supports pagination and filtering accurately.
Response time is under 200 ms for typical queries.
Invalid inputs return clear error messages.
API is secure and scoped to authorized users only.

Your job is to analyze this task and create a detailed feature specification. DO NOT include any code implementation.

Please provide:

1. **Feature Overview** (2-3 sentences)
   - What needs to be built
   - Why it's needed
   - Expected outcome

2. **Files to Modify** (CRITICAL - Be Specific)
   List exact file paths that need to be created or modified:
   - `path/to/file.js` - What changes are needed
   - `path/to/another.js` - What changes are needed
   - Include both new files and existing files to modify
   - Use relative paths from repository root

3. **Technical Approach** (4-6 bullet points)
   - High-level architecture decisions
   - Which parts of the codebase will be affected
   - Any dependencies or prerequisites
   - Potential challenges

4. **Implementation Steps** (numbered list)
   - Break down into logical steps
   - Reference specific files from "Files to Modify" section
   - Order of implementation

5. **Testing Strategy** (3-4 bullet points)
   - What should be tested
   - Types of tests needed
   - Edge cases to consider
   - Which test files to create/modify

6. **Acceptance Criteria** (checklist)
   - Specific requirements that must be met
   - Definition of done
   - How to verify the feature works

Format your response in clear Markdown. Be specific about file paths and changes. Focus on WHAT and WHY, not HOW (no code).
