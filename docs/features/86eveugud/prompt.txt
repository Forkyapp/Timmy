You are a senior software architect analyzing a development task.

**Task ID:** 86eveugud
**Title:** "EnvLens” — Environment Variable Inspector
**Description:**
Problem:
 Every project ends up with a mess of .env files, missing keys, or outdated variables.
Idea:
 A web or CLI tool that scans your project, loads .env.example, .env, and runtime usage (in code), and shows:
which vars are missing or unused
where each var is referenced in code
warnings for secrets committed by accident
Works for Node, Python, Go projects.
Useful for: catching config mistakes fast before deployment.
2. “API Schema Diff” — Compare Two OpenAPI Specs
Problem:
 APIs change silently; frontends break.
Idea:
 Upload or point to two Swagger/OpenAPI files → get a visual diff of added, removed, or changed endpoints, params, and schemas.
Include JSON diff and summary like “2 endpoints removed, 3 modified.”
Useful for: frontend–backend sync, version control in API teams.
3. “Docker Doctor” — Analyze Your Dockerfile
Problem:
 People copy bad Dockerfiles from Stack Overflow.
Idea:
 CLI tool that analyzes your Dockerfile and prints suggestions:
base image too big
missing .dockerignore
unused layers
unpinned versions
Optionally shows a “cleaned” version.
Useful for: anyone shipping containers, especially beginners.
4. “NPM Audit Visualizer”
Problem:
npm audit prints a wall of text nobody reads.
Idea:
 A simple web UI that parses npm audit --json output and visualizes:
dependency tree
vulnerabilities per package
quick fixes (npm audit fix --force suggestions)
Just drag-drop your audit file and see results.
Useful for: web devs maintaining multiple projects.
5. “Latency Watcher” — Local API Response Monitor
Problem:
 When developing locally, you can’t see how slow each endpoint is over time.
Idea:
 A local web dashboard that logs every API request your frontend makes (via a proxy or browser extension) and visualizes latency trends, failures, and payload sizes.
Useful for: debugging performance regressions.

Your job is to analyze this task and create a detailed feature specification. DO NOT include any code implementation.

Please provide:

1. **Feature Overview** (2-3 sentences)
   - What needs to be built
   - Why it's needed
   - Expected outcome

2. **Files to Modify** (CRITICAL - Be Specific)
   List exact file paths that need to be created or modified:
   - `path/to/file.js` - What changes are needed
   - `path/to/another.js` - What changes are needed
   - Include both new files and existing files to modify
   - Use relative paths from repository root

3. **Technical Approach** (4-6 bullet points)
   - High-level architecture decisions
   - Which parts of the codebase will be affected
   - Any dependencies or prerequisites
   - Potential challenges

4. **Implementation Steps** (numbered list)
   - Break down into logical steps
   - Reference specific files from "Files to Modify" section
   - Order of implementation

5. **Testing Strategy** (3-4 bullet points)
   - What should be tested
   - Types of tests needed
   - Edge cases to consider
   - Which test files to create/modify

6. **Acceptance Criteria** (checklist)
   - Specific requirements that must be met
   - Definition of done
   - How to verify the feature works

Format your response in clear Markdown. Be specific about file paths and changes. Focus on WHAT and WHY, not HOW (no code).
