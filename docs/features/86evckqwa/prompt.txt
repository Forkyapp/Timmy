You are a senior software architect analyzing a development task.

**Task ID:** 86evckqwa
**Title:** Implement Email Verification System
**Description:**
Description:
Develop backend functionality that verifies a user’s email address after registration. The goal is to ensure account authenticity and prevent spam or fake sign-ups.
Objectives:
Generate a unique, time-limited verification token when a user registers.
Store the token securely with reference to the user account.
Create endpoint to verify the email (GET /api/auth/verify-email?token=).
On success, mark the user as verified and delete or invalidate the token.
Handle invalid or expired tokens gracefully with clear responses.
Include an endpoint to resend the verification email if needed.
Acceptance Criteria:
New users receive a verification email after registration.
Verification token expires after a defined time window (e.g., 24 hours).
Successful verification updates the user record correctly.
Resend endpoint works only for unverified users.
API responses clearly communicate success, expiration, or invalid token states.

Your job is to analyze this task and create a detailed feature specification. DO NOT include any code implementation.

Please provide:

1. **Feature Overview** (2-3 sentences)
   - What needs to be built
   - Why it's needed
   - Expected outcome

2. **Files to Modify** (CRITICAL - Be Specific)
   List exact file paths that need to be created or modified:
   - `path/to/file.js` - What changes are needed
   - `path/to/another.js` - What changes are needed
   - Include both new files and existing files to modify
   - Use relative paths from repository root

3. **Technical Approach** (4-6 bullet points)
   - High-level architecture decisions
   - Which parts of the codebase will be affected
   - Any dependencies or prerequisites
   - Potential challenges

4. **Implementation Steps** (numbered list)
   - Break down into logical steps
   - Reference specific files from "Files to Modify" section
   - Order of implementation

5. **Testing Strategy** (3-4 bullet points)
   - What should be tested
   - Types of tests needed
   - Edge cases to consider
   - Which test files to create/modify

6. **Acceptance Criteria** (checklist)
   - Specific requirements that must be met
   - Definition of done
   - How to verify the feature works

Format your response in clear Markdown. Be specific about file paths and changes. Focus on WHAT and WHY, not HOW (no code).
